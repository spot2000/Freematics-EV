Data Collection
---------------

This project collects the following data:
-----------------------------------------
* Geolocation data (from internal or external GNSS) 
* Accelerometer and gyroscope data (from internal MEMS motion sensor)
* Cellular or WiFi network signal level
* Device temperature
* EV vehicle data via OBD port (See ABRP data list below)

List of ABRP data that is collected:
------------------------------------

High priority parameters:
-------------------------
* utc [s]: Current UTC timestamp (epoch) in seconds (note, not milliseconds!)
* soc [SoC %]: State of Charge of the vehicle (what's displayed on the dashboard of the vehicle is preferred)
* power [kW]: Instantaneous power output/input to the vehicle. Power output is positive, power input is negative (charging)
* speed [km/h]: Vehicle speed
* lat [°]: Current vehicle latitude
* lon [°]: Current vehicle longitude
* is_charging [bool or 1/0]: Determines vehicle state. 0 is not charging, 1 is charging
* is_dcfc [bool or 1/0]: If is_charging, indicate if this is DC fast charging
* is_parked [bool or 1/0]: If the vehicle gear is in P (or the driver has left the car)

The lower priority parameters (and expected units) are:
-------------------------------------------------------
* capacity [kWh]: Estimated usable battery capacity (can be given together with soh, but usually not)
* kwh_charged [kWh]: Measured energy input while charging. Typically a cumulative total, but also supports individual sessions.
* soh [%]: State of Health of the battery. 100 = no degradation
* heading [°]: Current heading of the vehicle. This will take priority over phone heading, so don't include if not accurate.
* elevation [m]: Vehicle's current elevation. If not given, will be looked up from location (but may miss 3D structures)
* ext_temp [°C]: Outside temperature measured by the vehicle
* batt_temp [°C]: Battery temperature
* voltage [V]: Battery pack voltage
* current [A]: Battery pack current (similar to power: output is positive, input (charging) is negative.)
* odometer [km]: Current odometer reading in km.
* est_battery_range [km]: Estimated remaining range of the vehicle (according to the vehicle)

Data storage:
-------------
Collected data are stored in a circular buffer in ESP32's IRAM or PSRAM. When PSRAM is enabled, hours of data can be buffered in case of temporary network outage and transmitted when network connection resumes.

Configuration handling:
-----------------------
Configuration of ABRP and WI-FI settings are done in the config files locatec in the cfg folder on the SD-card.

Additional SD-card overrides can be placed in the /cfg folder:
* /cfg/wifi.ini with:
  wifi_ssid=YOUR_WIFI_SSID
  wifi_password=YOUR_WIFI_PASSWORD
* /cfg/abrp.ini with:
  abrp_user_key=YOUR_ABRP_USER_KEY
Each file is a simple key=value list, one per line (no section headers).


Data Transmission
-----------------

Data transmission over UDP and HTTP(s) protocols are implemented for the followings.

* WiFi (ESP32 built-in)
* 3G WCDMA (SIM5360)
* 4G LTE CAT-4 (SIM7600)
* 4G LTE CAT-M (SIM7070)

Seamless WiFi and cellular network co-working is implemented. When defined WiFi hotspot is available, data is transmitted via WiFi and cellular module is switched off. When no WiFi hotspot can be reached, cellular module is switched on for data transmission until WiFi hotspot available again.

Data Storage
------------
Following types of data storage are supported.

* MicroSD card storage
* ESP32 built-in Flash memory storage (SPIFFS)

BLE & App
---------
Planned support in the future for ability to link phone to Freematic adapter to view data in a easy way. (not ready yet)
